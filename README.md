# puma_permeability_calibration

## Overview

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis scripts for calibrating permeability layers to upload into EcoScape. It includes spatial data, R data objects, and figure outputs supporting our ecological research.

## Data Description

The core data includes:

- `.rda` files: R data objects storing original and processed datasets, and model results.
- `.tif` files: Geospatial raster data used for input into EcoScape model.
- `.png` files: Figure outputs generated by the analysis scripts.

Large data files are managed using [Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to keep the repository efficient and performant.

## Repository Structure
- `Puma Permeability Calibration.Rproj/`: RProject maintaining directory structure. 
- `scripts/`: R scripts for data processing, modeling, and figure creation.
- `data/tmp/`: Temporary or intermediate `.rda` files generated or used during analysis.
- `rasters_for_collab/[sex]/`: `.tif` raster files representing tolerance and sex-specific permeability, for input into EcoScape.
- `output/`: Generated `.png` visualizations.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- R version >= 4.x
- Install required R packages (see `requirements.R`)
- Git LFS installed and enabled on your system (required for large data files)

### Installing Git LFS

If you haven't installed Git LFS, follow instructions at https://git-lfs.github.com/

## Running the code

Before running any R scripts that load large data files, ensure you have pulled all Git LFS files using `system(git lfs pull)`, or if using the provided scripts, the embedded command will run automatically.

## Reproducibility & Publishing

This repository is prepared to be published on Dryad alongside the associated manuscript. It contains all data and code needed to reproduce key results, following best practices for reproducible open science.
