# puma_permeability_calibration

## Overview

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis scripts for calibrating permeability layers to upload into EcoScape. It includes spatial data, R data objects, and figure outputs supporting our ecological research.

## Data Description

The core data includes:

- `.rda` files: R data objects storing original and processed datasets, and model results.
- `.tif` files: Geospatial raster data used for input into EcoScape model.
- `.png` files: Figure outputs generated by the analysis scripts.

Large data files are managed using [Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to keep the repository efficient and performant.

## Repository Structure
- `Puma Permeability Calibration.Rproj/`: RProject maintaining directory structure. 
- `scripts/`: R scripts for data processing, modeling, and figure creation.
- `data/tmp/`: Temporary or intermediate `.rda` files generated or used during analysis.
- `rasters_for_collab/[sex]/`: `.tif` raster files representing tolerance and sex-specific permeability, for input into EcoScape.
- `output/`: Generated `.png` visualizations.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- R version >= 4.x
- Install required R packages (see `requirements.R`)
- Git LFS installed and enabled on your system (required for large data files)

### Installing Git LFS

If you haven't installed Git LFS, follow instructions at https://git-lfs.github.com/

## Running the code

Before running any R scripts that load large data files, ensure you have pulled all Git LFS files using `system(git lfs pull)`, or if using the provided scripts, the embedded command will run automatically.

## Reproducibility & Publishing

This repository is prepared to be published on Dryad alongside the associated manuscript. It contains all data and code needed to reproduce key results, following best practices for reproducible open science.

### Data Metadata for Puma Permeability Calibration Repository

This section provides descriptions and usage notes for the main data files stored in the `data/`, `tmp/`, and `output/` folders within this repository.


## `data/` Folder

### `implicit_data.rda`
- Key data frames include:
  - `implicit_used_control`: Individual IDs (`pumaID`), step ID (`end_gpsID`), step length, log of step length, turning angle, case/control indicators (`case_`), control point id (`avail_id`), and habitat covariates for associated steps. Habitat covariates include slope, tree/shrub cover (`cover`), a kernel density estimation of building density at a 150m bandwidth (`hd_150`), proximity to urban edge (`prox_urbanedge`), and landcover designation (natural or anthropogenic; `landcover_simp`)
    - habitat covariates come from publicly available landcover data, including ICLUS (for `landcover_simp`), TIGER (`prox_urbanedge`), Microsoft's GlobalMLBuildingFootprints (`hd_150`), slope taken from a DEM model calculated by the National Elevation Dataset (`slope`), and percent tree/shrub cover calculated from California GAP data (`cover`). 
    - Contains cleaned, 3-hour resolution puma movement data from 84 individual pumas, collared between 2009 and 2024, used for integrated step selection function (iSSF) modeling to estimate habitat selection and movement behavior parameters.  
  - `scaling_averages`: contains the average covariate values across all environmental data in the Santa Cruz mountains study area
    - used to mean-center and scale covariates before model fitting
  - `scaling_sds`: contains the standard deviation of all covariate values across all environmental data in the Santa Cruz mountains study area
      - used to mean-center and scale covariates before model fitting\


- Loaded in `01_fitting_issas_and_extracting_coeffs.R`.

### `env.rda`
- Includes spatial data needed for preparing spatial projections, including designating traffic/city masks, reclassifying landcover layers, and designating seed habitat for EcoScape
- Key data includes:
  - `iclus key`: a dataset with the code (pixel values in the `lulc_current` raster layer), corresponding group and class names, and the simplified landcover designation used to describe a landcover type as "natural" (1) or "anthropogenic" (2). Designation for codes to class names was communicated via personal email from Phillip Moorefield. Dataset is used to reclassify `lulc_current` raster layer to 1/2 distribution.
  - `lulc_current` described above
  - `r` is a rasterized MCP containing all known GPS locations (same locations of used steps in `implicit_used_control`)
  - `road_shp`: spatial features object of all known paved roads, extracted from TIGER
  - `sc_protected`: spatial features object of all protected areas in Santa Cruz, taken from California Protected Areas Database
  - `stk`: raster stack containing raw environmental data described as habitat covariates in `implicit_used_control`
  - `traffic`: spatial features object of spatially-explicit traffic counts per road segment, taken from Average Annual Daily Traffic from California State GeoPortal


- Loaded in `02_projection_data_prep.R`.

## `tmp/` Folder

### `ind_coefs_and_weights.rda`

- Stores extracted individual-level coefficient estimates (`coef_db`) and weighted coefficients summary (`weighted_df`) from iSSF models fitted in `01_fitting_issas_and_extracting_coeffs.R`.  
- Also contains unnormalized weight matrices for males and females (`weights_m_unnorm`, `weights_f_unnorm`).  
- Used for downstream inference about sex-specific behavioral parameters and population-level coefficients.


- Loaded in `03_tolerance_permeability_projections.R` and `04_figures2&s1.R`


### `data_for_projections.rda`

- Stores results from `02_projection_data_prep.R` including processed masks e.g. urban (`city_mask`) and weighted roads mask (with traffic values; `weight_mask`).  
- Contains `design_matrix`, created with "new data" that is all environmental raster data (from `stk`) that spans entirety of Central California, but mean-scaled and centered based on averages and standard deviations calculated in Santa Cruz's study area (`scaling_averages` and `scaling_sds`)
- `r_final_masked` which is an updated version of `r` that only includes protected areas and excludes pixels overlapping with roads (`roads_shp`)
- a reclassified version of `lulc_current`, called `lulc_current_reclassed`
- Used for projecting sex- and tolerance-specific coefficients to calibrate permeability layers, and for visualizing spread of coefficients by tolerance/sex in figures


- Loaded in `03_tolerance_permeability_projections.R`


### `tolerance_specific_pumas.rda`

- Stores the sex- and toleranace-specific puma coefficient values designated in the beginning of `03_tolerance_permeability_projections.R`
- Used for visualizing spread of coefficients by tolerance/sex in figures

- Loaded in `04_figures2&s1.R`.


---

## `output/` Folder

- Contains generated figures from the analysis pipeline. 
- Serves as the primary location for saving processed results to aid reproducibility and reporting.

---

## Notes:

- Some files in `data/` are large and managed through Git LFS. Be sure to run `git lfs pull` before your workflow to download large data objects.  
- All `.rda` files are binary R data objects. Load them in R using `load("filename.rda")`.  
- File structure and naming are chosen to help trace data transformations from raw movement data to fitted model results and visual summaries.

---

## Suggested Usage

- Start analyses by loading data objects from the `data/` folder.  
- Intermediate results and model coefficients are saved to the `tmp/` folder to enable modular workflow execution.  
- Final outputs, including figures and tables suitable for manuscript or presentation, are saved in `output/`.
